## Design philosphy
This keyboard [was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=800tXbrIh_E) with FDM printing in mind, the goal was to make a perfect curved case that can be easily printed and looks aesthetically pleasing with minimal amount of so called "steps" that plague similar 3D keyboards like Dactyl Manuform. This is mostly inspired by the Cygnus, Smudge and Chonky Bois keyboards, we wanted to make a similar "organic" shaped keyboard but much more optimized for FDM printing, easy assembly and looking good not only on a photo but also in real life üòé
